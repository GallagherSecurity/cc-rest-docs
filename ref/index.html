                <p>Welcome to the developer documentation for the Command Centre REST interface.</p>
                <p>The files linked from here show you how you can manage Command Centre using HTTP requests. Each file contains an introduction to its particular area of the API, instructions on authenticating to the server, and tips on how to accomplish common tasks, as well as the usual reference information for paths and data.</p>
                <p>They do not show how to set up the Command Centre server to answer your REST calls. To do that, search the Configuration Client&#39;s online help for &#39;REST&#39;.</p>
                <p>You could also look at the sample code shipped with Command Centre, on the install media alongside this documentation in the &#39;Utilities/REST API&#39; folder. There are several Visual Studio projects that compile into .NET applications you could observe making HTTP requests against your own server (in a development environment, of course).</p>

                    <p>The performance improvements were such that we felt it worthwhile to port it back to all supported versions, so it is also present in the latest maintenance releases of 9.10 through 9.40.</p>
