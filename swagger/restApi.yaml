  title: "Command Centre REST API:  Non-cardholder items"
  description: |
    This document describes how you can use the Command Centre REST API to view and manage
    access zones, alarm zones, fence zones, doors, macros, inputs, and outputs.

    It has companion documents describing the [Cardholders](cardholders.html) and [Alarms and
    Events](events.html) APIs, and Command Centre's handling of [PIV cards](piv.html).

    It assumes some familiarity with HTTP and REST interfaces.  Before you start
    developing against this interface, you should also read the [Authentication
    section](#topic-Authentication) to learn how to format your queries, and Command Centre's
    Configuration Client online help to learn how to ready the server to receive them
    (search for 'REST API').

    Each section contains a list of use cases intended as quick solutions for simple tasks
    or a how-to to get you started toward your particular goal.  However they also serve
    as a good introduction to the API if you step through them using a web browser,
    starting at `/api` on port 8904 of your Command Centre server.  To do that, you will
    need to set up Command Centre, and install a browser plugin on your web client that
    lets you set an Authorization HTTP header, and a JSON formatter to prettify the
    results documents.  Search the Configuration client's online help for 'test REST API'
    for guidance.

    ### Licensing

    All of the GET calls described here require the RESTStatus licence.  All the POSTs require
    RESTOverrides.  The two licences do not overlap:  to watch an item and override it, you will
    need both.

    ### Changes in 8.60

    8.60 increases the number of items in its search results and sorts them differently, if the
    query did not use query parameters to override the defaults.

    ### Changes in 8.50

    * A [schedules API](#tag-Schedules) providing CRUD of the six schedule item types.

    * A [day categories API](#tag-Day-Categories) that returns the day categories you need for those
      schedules.

    ### Changes in 8.30

    All changes to this document contain the text "8.30".

    * A 'connectedController' field in the [door detail](#definition-Door-detail) that returns the
      ID and name of the door's hardware controller (a C6000 controller, not an API controller).

    ### Changes in 8.20

    All changes to this document contain the text "8.20".

    * An [update_cardholder_location](#operation--api-access_zones-update_cardholder_location-get)
      call on the Access Zones API that returns you the list of Access Zones into which your
      operator is allowed to move cardholders.

    ### Changes in 8.10

    All changes to this document contain the text "8.10".

    * An [inputs API](#tag-Inputs) that gives you the state of 'input' hardware items and lets you
      override them.  It is very similar to the outputs API.

    ### Efficiency tips

    * When downloading more than one page of items, sort by ID.

    * Set your page size as large as your client can handle.  The defualt used to be 100; using the
      `top` parameter to take it to 1000 or more gives _much_ better throughput.

    * (In v8.00 or later) avoid the details page by adding detail fields to the summary page with
      the [`fields` parameter](#topic-Field-specifiers).  One summary page of 1,000 items, while
      huge, is much quicker to retrieve than 1,000 detail pages.

      For example, to get the names, doors, and override commands of all your access zones:

        `GET /api/access_zones?fields=name,doors,commands`

    * (In v8.00 or later) save work generating the details page by using the [`fields`
      parameter](#topic-Field-specifiers) to reduce the amount of data on each page.  Be explicit:
      do not use `fields=defaults`, unless you need every field that 'defaults' gives you.

    * When searching for an item by name, if you have its exact name, put it in quotes `"..."`.
      Otherwise Command Centre will perform a substring search, which is slower and may return more
      results than you need.  Even with quotes, the search is case-insensitive.

  Item status:
    description: |

      Most items have a status.  Access zones, for example, can be in one of a few different modes,
      and have a _zone count_ that rises and falls with cardholders arriving and leaving.  Inputs
      and outputs can be on or off.  Any item can be in an unknown state when the REST server is out
      of touch with its hardware.  Et cetera.

      The REST API can send an item's status to you in a string ready for human consumption in a UI,
      or as a list of flags more suitable for an integration.  Neither of those fields are on an
      item's summary or details pages by default; to obtain them reliably you need to subscribe to
      updates.

      ### Subscribing to status updates

      The server does not always have an item's status:  to prevent unnecessary work on the
      controller, network, and server, it will stop requesting updates when nothing is subscribed to
      them.  It is very important that items stay in touch with their controllers, and controllers
      with each other, but it is normal for controllers to limit what they send back to the server.

      The server will be up to date when one of the following happened recently:

      - an operator had the item visible in the Configuration, Command Centre, or mobile clients,
      - an application monitored the item via another API,
      - a REST client used the item in a [status subscription](events.html#status-subscriptions), or
      - a REST client followed the item's `updates` link from its details page.

      If it is not up to date and you request the status on an item's summary or details page, the
      server will report that the status is unknown.

      To retrieve the status of one item you should GET the item's `updates` link from its details
      page.  To monitor the status of many items you should use the [status subscription
      API](events.html#status-subscriptions) on the items controller (added in 8.30).

      Whichever API you use, if the server does not have an item's status when you ask it will
      request an update from the item itself.  For hardware items that may involve a conversation
      with another server, a hardware controller, and another piece of hardware on the end of a
      serial line.  That all takes time, but the server answers you immediately, so the first
      response you receive may be 'unknown'.  The status request continues in the background.

      No matter what you receive, you should follow the `next` link in a loop until it gives you a
      status you are looking for, or another status indicating why it cannot.  Your original request
      started a subscription, which every subsequent request refreshes, so while you stay in that
      loop the server will have the item's current status for you and all other callers.

      The first status you will receive after 'unknown' will probably be 'controller unknown', which
      means that the controller (or other hardware) has received the server's request but does not
      yet have an answer, because of that serial line.  You need something better, so stay in the
      loop.

      ### Staying current

      When you use the `updates` link on the item's details page it will return immediately.  When
      follow the `next` link in the page it returns, it will send back the status straight away if
      it changed since your previous call, or block until it does change.  If nothing happens within
      a minute or so, it will return with no updates.

      Whether you received an update or not, the body will contain a `next` link for you to follow
      for the next update.

      State changes are not queued:  the API only keeps the last, so it only takes one call to get
      yourself up to date with the server.  Remember that the server itself may not have been up to
      date, and your making the call will have started it on its own little journey of discovery,
      which will cause more updates.

      The 'Site' tab of the sample application shows this in operation.

      ### For a user interface

      The `statusText` field describes the state of the item in a multi-line string taken from the
      server's language pack.  The natural state of a door, for example, is

      <pre>
      Closed, locked, secure access.
      </pre>

      A fence zone's status text could be

      <pre>
      On - HV.
      Voltage: 8.2 kV.
      Seven day High Voltage min to max: 0.1kV to 9.8kV.
      Pre-arm check while Alarm Zone is arming.
      </pre>

      For one-line display, the `status` field is the same thing with line feeds replaced by spaces.

      Neither of these is intended for integrations.  By all means display them in a user interface
      (as Gallagher software does) but do not attempt to parse information out of them.

      ### For an integration

      The `statusFlags` field contains an array of string enumerations (flags) that describe the
      item's condition in a reliable and machine-readable way.

      Each item type has a different set of flags.  Some overlap (doors, inputs, and outputs can all
      be closed, for example) but most flags apply to only one kind of item.  The common exceptions
      are the flags which indicate why the server cannot return the item's actual status, covered
      next.

      #### Abnormal status flags

      These are the status flags that indicate the server does not have the current status of the
      item:

      - `unsaved` and `deleted` are transient conditions you should not encounter in normal use.
        Either way, the item is in no condition to query.

      - `unconfigured` is very common while a site is being set up.  It means the item is not fully
        configured yet.  An access zone is not configured until it has at least one door, for
        example.

      - `remoteServerOffline` is only possible in a multi-server setup.  It means that the item is
        remote (on a different server) and the server answering your REST query cannot reach it.

      - `processOffline` means the Controller service that is meant to be running on the Command
        Centre server, and handling all the communications with hardware controllers, is not.

      - `controllerOffline` means the software on the server is as it should be but the hardware
        controller (such as a C6000) is offline.  That could mean it needs its certificate
        revalidated, or just that its power or networking is out.

      - `notPolled` means the item is shunted:  Command Centre is ignoring the item's
        communications at the request of an operator.  You normally do it to stop spurious alarms.

      - `deviceNotResponding` means exactly that.  It means the server is in contact with the
         hardware controller, but there is a problem between there and the item.  Probably a cable
         fault, unless `encryptionKeysTampered` accompanies it.

      Those are fault conditions.  If you see one of those, there is a configuration or hardware
      fault or a shunt preventing the server communicating with the item.

      They are in priority order:  if you receive one near the bottom of the list you can take heart
      in the knowledge that your item is suffering none of the preceding abnormalities.

      There are two more flags that are common to most item types.

      - `unknown` means everything else is in order but you caught the server in a period when it
        simply had no need to stay in touch with the item.  You will get this on a summary or
        details page, because they do not subscribe to updates for the item.  The 'updates' link
        will not send you this status flag.

      - `controllerUnknown` is a transient state, hopefully.  The 'updates' call often returns it
        the first time if the server does not have the item's status already.  It means a component
        (such as a hardware controller) between the server and your item is working on bringing in
        an update.  This generally resolves quickly, so if you follow the 'next' link you will
        receive the latest status.

      The server will not send any other flags with one of those eleven, apart from the possible
      pairing of `encryptionKeysTampered` and `deviceNotResponding`, and some unusual combinations
      noted later.

      Do not go looking for all of the abnormal status flags above and assume the best if they are
      not there.  Gallagher may add more fault conditions in future versions of the API.

      Instead, read each item's section under Operations for what its flags will be when it is
      online.  A paragraph called "flag rules" shows how you can tell if the item is in a correct
      state.  For the impatient:  doors, inputs, and outputs will be open or closed, fence zones
      will be on or off, and alarm and access zones will be in one of four zone states.

              The number of cardholders in the zone, according to its zone counting configuration.

              An access zone's count is part of its state, so [all that reading](#topic-Item-status)
              applies here too.  The authoritative source is the zone's hardware controller, so the
              REST server only has it if it is monitoring it for another reason.  If it is not, it
              returns a zero.

              That is why zone counts are not in the default set of fields.  You can ask for them
              using the 'fields' parameter, but you risk receiving a zero, so the recommended way is
              to follow the Access Zone's 'updates' link with `fields=defaults,zoneCount` appended
              after the appropriate query parameter separator.

              A zone count is correct iff the access zone is online:  the status flags must contain
              one of 'secure', 'dualAuth', 'codeOrCard', or 'free'.  Even then, the zone count could
              be a minute out of date (depending on a server property that determines how long a
              hardware item can be silent before the server calls it offline).

- name: "Access Zones"

  description: |
    These methods give you read access to Access Zones in the Command Centre database, and
    let you change their modes, lock them down, and send other overrides.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search
    interface that gives you very basic data for any number of access zones.  Most
    important is a field called 'href', which gives location of one alarm zone's details
    page.

    ### Overrides

    Note:

    1. End-times on overrides are not accurate to the second.  Internally, Command Centre
       converts the end time to a duration, so you may find that submitting end times in
       the very near future does not have the exact effect you expect.
    2. Submitting an override without an end time makes it take effect until the next
       mode change or 'cancel untimed overrides' entry in the access zone's schedule.
    3. The end time you set for an override cannot be in the past or more than 24 hours into
       the future.

    ### Status flags

    If the access zone is online, its `statusFlags` field may contain one or more of these flags:

    - `saltoOutputOnly` means the the access zone would be considered unconfigured because it is
      missing doors, and therefore offline, except that it has a Salto output number assigned to it.
      That is a normal operational configuration.

    - `mobileZone` also means the access zone would be considered unconfigured (missing doors) and
      therefore offline, except that a mobile reader is able to badge cardholders into it, making it
      a perfectly useful access zone.  It will also have a `secure` flag.

    - `lockedDown` means only cardholders with the privilege to enter locked-down zones shall pass.
      The zone will also be 'secure'.  When the lockdown override ends it will return to its
      previous access mode.
    - `usePin` means when you use a card at a reader to unlock the door or at a terminal to control
      an alarm zone, you will also need your PIN.
    - `zoneCountTooHigh` means the zone count is above its maximum.
    - `zoneCountTooLow` means the zone count is below its minimum.
    - `zoneCountInGrace` means the zone count recently became too low or high.

    The following four give the zone's access state.  An online access zone will always return one
    of them.

    - `secure` means the doors are locked.
    - `dualAuth` means the doors are locked and - depending on configuration - cardholders will need
      a second credential to open them.
    - `codeOrCard` means you can unlock a door either with a card, the zone's access code, or (if
      suitably configured on the reader) a personal user code.  You will not see this flag if the
      zone is locked down.
    - `free` means the zone's doors are unlocked.  You will not see this when the zone is locked down.

    #### Access Zone flag rules

    - If and only if the zone online and not locked down, there will be exactly one of 'secure',
      'dualAuth', 'codeOrCard', or 'free'.

    - If and only if the zone online and locked down, there will be exactly one of 'secure' or
      'dualAuth'.

    - Because 'saltoOutputOnly' and 'mobileZone' are variations of the unconfigured offline
      condition, 'saltoOutputOnly' will be alone and only 'secure' will accompany 'mobileZone'.

    - If a zone has both a Salto output number and mobile access, only 'saltoOutputOnly' will
      appear.

    - If there is 'zoneCountInGrace' there will always be exactly one of 'zoneCountTooHigh' or
      'zoneCountTooLow' (never both).

    Using the first three rules above, your test for an access zone being in error is 'secure',
    'dualAuth', 'codeOrCard', 'free', 'saltoOutputOnly', and 'mobileZone' all missing.

    ### Use cases

    #### Searching for access zones by name
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.accessZones.accessZones.href`, appending a search term such as
       `name=substring` to filter the access zones, and `fields` to tell the server what to return
       about each.  The next section covers those query parameters.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link until there isn't one.

    #### Changing an access zone's access mode
    1. Find the href for the access zone using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    3. Find the API URL you require in the `commands` structure of the results, such as
    `free` or `securePin`, from [the detail](#definition-Access-Zone-detail).  Use the
    `until` variants if you are specifying an end time.
    4. POST to that URL.  Some require a JSON object (resetting the zone count, and all
    those with `until` in their command block keys).  The others expect an empty body.

    #### Finding an access zone's status
    1. Find the href for the access zone using the process above, and GET it.
    3. Take the `updates` href from that page.  For a version 8.00 server append the query parameter
       separator ('?' or '&') then `fields=defaults,zoneCount` if you need the zone count as well as
       the default status fields.  The zone count is included by default in 8.10 and later.
    4. GET it.
    5. Use the flag rules above to interpret the statusFlags you receive.
    5. Follow the `next` link to stay up to date.

- name: "Alarm Zones"
  description: |
    These methods give you read access to Alarm Zones in the Command Centre database, and
    let you change their states:  armed, disarmed, two user-defined states, and (if at
    least one Fence Zone is directing its events to this Alarm Zone) 'Armed - High
    Voltage' or 'Armed - Low Feel'.

    Alarm zones may run by a schedule, but it is optional.  Alarm zones that do not have a
    schedule change state only through manual overrides, meaning they do not have a
    natural state.  That in turn means that you cannot override them for a duration --
    they have no state to return to.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search
    interface that gives you very basic data for any number of alarm zones.  The href
    field gives location of an alarm zone's details page.

    ### Overrides
    Note:

    1. End-times on overrides are not accurate to the second.  Internally, Command Centre
       converts the end time to a duration, so you may find that submitting end times in
       the very near future does not have the exact effect you expect.
    2. Submitting an override without an end time makes it take effect until the next
       state change or 'cancel untimed overrides' entry in the alarm zone's schedule.
    3. Overrides you submit via REST are not subject to the "manual unset" timeouts you
       can set in the Configuration Client.  Those only affect readers, terminals, and
       pushbuttons.
    3. The end time you set for an override cannot be in the past or more than 24 hours into
       the future.

    ### Status flags

    If the alarm zone is online, its `statusFlags` field will contain one or more of these flags:

    - `armed` means the alarm zone is armed.  It will be called that even if you have changed the
      terminology in the Server Properties.
    - `disarmed` as above.
    - `user1` will be called that even if you have given it a different name in Server Properties.
    - `user2` as above.
    - `exitDelay` means the zone is temporarily ignoring input triggers.  One of the previous four
      flags shows you the state the zone is about to change away from.
    - `entryDelay` means an input has triggered the alarm zone but Command Centre is giving a
      cardholder the opportunity to disarm the zone.

    - `lowFeel` means the alarm zone has a fence zone attached, and that it is in 'low feel' mode
      (meaning it is delivering lower voltage than you would use for a strong deterrant).
    - `highVoltage` means that the alarm zone has a fence zone attached, and that it is 'high
      voltage' mode (meaning it is delivering a strong deterrant pulse).

    #### Alarm Zone flag rules

    - If and only if the zone is online, there will exactly one of 'armed', 'disarmed', 'user1', or
      'user2'.  That is your test for whether an alarm zone is in error.
    - 'exitDelay' and 'entryDelay' cannot appear together.
    - If and only if the zone is online and has a fence zone, there will be exactly one of 'lowFeel'
      or 'highVoltage'.

    ### Use cases

    #### Searching for alarm zones by name
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.alarmZones.alarmZones.href`, appending a search term such as
       `name=substring` to filter the access zones, and `fields` to tell the server what to return
       about each.  The next section covers those query parameters.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link until there isn't one.

    #### Changing an alarm zone's state
    1. Find the href for the alarm zone using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    3. Find the API URL you require in the `commands` structure of the results, such as
    `arm` or `disarm`, using [the detail](#definition-Alarm-Zone-detail).  Use the calls
    with `Until` on the ends of their names if you are specifying an end time.
    4. POST to that URL.  All those with `Until` in their names require a JSON object in
    the body giving the time at which the override should end; the others do not.

    #### Finding an alarm zone's status
    1. Find the href for the alarm zone using the process above, and GET it.
    3. Follow the `updates` href from that page.
    4. Use the flag rules above to interpret the status flags you receive.
    5. Follow the `next` link to stay up to date.

- name: "Day Categories"
  description: |-
    A day category links a calendar to a schedule.  The calendar determines the days of the year
    that fall into a day category, and the schedule determines what happens at certain times on
    those days.

    The method in this group gives you the day category hrefs you need when creating and modifying
    schedules.

    Day categories are new to the 8.50 API.

    ### Use case:  listing day categories
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.dayCategories.dayCategories.href`, appending a search term such
       as `name=substring` or `name="full name"` to filter the selection, and `fields` to tell the
       server what to return about each day category.
    3. Search the results for the day category you are after.  Normally you would follow the `next`
       link until there isn't one, but day categories are not that numerous so they will most likely
       to fit on one page.  Especially if you set `top=1000` (which is advised).

- name: "Doors"
  description: |-
    These methods give you read access to basic data about Doors in the Command Centre
    database, and let you open them.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search
    interface that gives you very basic data for any number of doors.  The href field for
    each door gives the location of another page which gives more details, including the
    URL you need to open the door.

    ### Status flags

    If the door is online, its `statusFlags` field will contain one or more of these flags:

    - `forced` means the door was opened or unlocked while secure.
    - `openTooLong` means the door has been open for longer than its configured DOTL time.
    - `tamper` means one of the door's inputs is in a tampered state.  The usual cause of that is a
      resistance moving outside nominal range, meaning the input has been cut or shorted.
    - `open` means the door has a sensor for detecting its openness and it is reporting as such.
    - `closed` is the inverse.  The door is closed or has no open sensor.
    - `locked` means the door locked.  It reflects the state of the door's unlock sensor, if it has
      one.  Otherwise it reflects the state of the door's unlock output, if it has that.  Without an
      unlock output, a door is not capable of access control.
    - `unlocked` means 'locked' is not set.
    - `secure` means the door's normal state is closed and locked.
    - `free` is the opposite of 'secure' -- nobody needs to badge to open it.

    `secure` and `free` do not change when the door opens.  They are about whether the door is
    enforcing access control, not about the current state of the door hardware.

    When allowing passage, a door normally moves from closed and locked to closed and unlocked, to
    open and unlocked (extremely briefly), then to open and locked while someone is walking through
    it, then back to closed and locked.  It will be secure throughout.

    #### Door flag rules

    - If and only if the door is online, exactly one of 'closed' or 'open' will appear, and one of
      'locked' or 'unlocked', and one of 'secure' or 'free'.

    So, to establish if the door is in a normal state, look for 'closed' or 'open'.  If neither is
    present, your door is in an error state.

    ### Use cases

    #### Listing Doors
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.doors.doors.href`, appending a search term such as
       `name=substring` to filter the selection if you have a lot of doors, and `fields` to tell the
       server what to return about each.  The next section covers those query parameters.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link until there isn't one.

    #### Opening a Door
    1. Find the href for the door using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    3. POST to the 'open' URL in the `commands` structure of the
       [results](#definition-Door-detail).

    #### Finding a door's status
    1. Find the href for the door  using the process above, and GET it.
    3. Follow the `updates` href from that page.
    4. Use the flag rules above to interpret the status flags you receive.
    5. Follow the `next` link to stay up to date.

- name: "Fence Zones"
  description: |
    These methods give you read access to Fence Zones in the Command Centre database, and
    let you turn them on and off, change their modes, and shunt them.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search
    interface that gives you very basic data for any number of fence zones.  Most
    important is a field called 'href', which gives location of one fence zone's details
    page.

    ### Status flags

    If the fence zone is online, its `statusFlags` field may contain one or more of these flags:

    - `notPolled` means the fence zone is shunted, which means intentionally ignored, and is
      essentially offline.
    - `overridden` means just that.
    - `deterrentUnknown` means the controller cannot determine the state of the fence zone.  This
      happens when there is a cabling problem between the C6000 and the fence controller
      (energiser).
    - `on` means the fence zone is live, energised.  Take care.
    - `off` means the fence zone is off.
    - `lowFeel` means the fence energiser is delivering enough voltage to detect disturbances.
      Depending on the fence zone's configuration, it may also be a deterrant.
    - `highVoltage` means the pulse is delivering a deterrant pulse.
    - `hVPlusMode` means the fence voltage has increased in response to a disturbance.  After some
      time or an override it will leave this mode.  See the description of HVPlus mode in the
      Configuration Client's online help.
    - `serviceMode` means a technician has manually forced service mode at the fence controller.
      This safety measure prevents a Command Centre operator energising a hardware technician.
    - `voltageKnown` means Command Centre has the current voltage for the zone, provided there has
      been at least one pulse from the energiser recently.  This can only happen when the zone is
      on, obviously.  The 'voltage' field will contain the voltage at the last pulse.
    - `alert` means the fence voltage is outside the alert range.  Typically this means an electical problem.
    - `warning` means the fence voltage is between the alert and warning ranges.  Typically this
      means it has grounded somewhere.
    - `preArm` means the zone is performing its pre-arm check.
    - `lockedOut` means the zone has been locked out at a keypad.
    - `parentAlert` means there is a problem with the fence controller.

    #### Fence Zone flag rules

    - If and only if the fence zone is online, there will be exactly one of 'deterrentUnknown',
      'on', or 'off'.  That is your test for whether a fence zone is in error.
    - If 'on', there will be exactly one of 'lowFeel', 'highVoltage', or 'hVPlusMode'.
    - If 'off', there will be exactly one of 'lowFeel' or 'highVoltage'.
    - 'hVPlusMode' will only appear if the fence zone is on.
    - If there is 'alert' there will never be 'warning'.
    - None of the flags above will appear if the fence zone is offline and only 'notPolled'
      will appear if it is not polled.  
    - The 'voltage' field only contains a valid value if you receive 'voltageKnown' and the
      energiser has pulsed at least once since the zone turned on.

    ### Use cases

    #### Searching for fence zones by name
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.fenceZones.fenceZones.href`, appending a search term such as
       `name=substring` to filter the fence zones, and `fields` to tell the server what to return
       about each.  The next section covers those query parameters.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link until there isn't one.

    #### Overriding a fence zone
    1. Find the href for the fence zone using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    3. Find the API URL you require in the `commands` structure of the results, such as
    `off`, `highVoltage`, or `shunt`, from [the detail](#definition-Fence-Zone-detail).
    4. POST to that URL.  You do not need to send anything in the body of the POST.

    #### Finding a fence zone's status
    1. Find the href for the fence zone using the process above, and GET it.
    3. Take the `updates` href from that page.  For a version 8.00 server append
       `?fields=defaults,voltage` if you are after the fence's voltage.  It is included by default
       in 8.10 and later.
    4. GET it.
    4. Use the flag rules above to interpret the status flags you receive.
    5. Follow the `next` link to stay up to date.

- name: "Inputs"
  description: |-
    These methods, introduced in v8.10, give you read and override access to Input items.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search interface
    that gives you basic data for any number of inputs.  The href field for each input gives the
    location of another page which gives more details, including the URLs you need to shunt or
    isolate it.

    ### Status flags

    Even though the Configuration client lets you set your own state names for open, closed,
    tampered open, and tampered short, status flags will always use 'closed' or 'open', and possibly
    'tamper'.

    Two-state inputs cannot report a tamper, because it is impossible to detect.  They can only be
    open or closed.  Hence the name.

    Three-state inputs can report a tamper, but only one of tampered open or tampered closed,
    depending on their end-of-line resistance settings.

    Four-state inputs can report tampered open (an open circuit) or tampered closed (a short).

    If the input is online, its `statusFlags` field may contain one or more of these flags:

    - `closed` means the input circuit is closed.
    - `open` means the input circuit is open.

    - `tamper` means the input circuit is shorted or open.
    - `notPolled` means the input is shunted, which means intentionally ignored, and is essentially
      offline.
    - `isolated` means the input state will not prevent arming an alarm zone.

    #### Input flag rules

    - If and only if the input is online and not shunted ('notPolled' status flag), exactly one of
      'closed' or 'open' will appear.

    - 'closed' or 'open' may still appear if the input is tampered.

    So, to establish if the input is in a completely normal state, look for 'closed' or 'open', and
    make sure 'tamper' is _not_ there.  However bear in mind that inputs are often shunted for
    ordinary reasons.

    ### Use cases

    #### Listing Inputs
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.inputs.inputs.href`, appending a search term such as
       `name=substring` to select the inputs, `top` if you expect lots of them, and `fields` to tell
       the server what to return about each.  The next section covers those query parameters.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link if there is one.

    #### Overriding an Input
    1. Find the href for the input using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    3. Find the API URL to for the override you need in the `commands` structure of the
       [results](#definition-Input-detail).
    4. POST to that URL with an empty body.

    #### Finding an input's status
    1. Find the href for the input using the process above, and GET it.
    3. Take the `updates` href from that page.
    4. GET it.
    4. Use the flag rules above to interpret the status flags you receive.
    5. Follow the `next` link to stay up to date.

- name: "Macros"
  description: |
    These methods give you read access to basic data about the Macros in the Command
    Centre database, and let you run them.

    Reading the section 'Understanding Macros' in the Configuration client help is an
    excellent way to do exactly that.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search
    interface that gives you very basic data for any number of macros.  The href field for
    each macro gives the location of another page which gives more details, including the
    URL you need to run the macro.

    ### Overrides

    You cannot use the REST API to change a macro's schedule.  You must use the Command
    Centre or Configuration client for that.

    ### Use cases

    #### Listing Macros
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.macros.macros.href`, appending a search term
       (described below) to narrow the results if your
       installation has a lot of macros.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link until there isn't one.

    #### Running a Macro
    1. Find the href for the macro using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    4. If your operator is able to run the macro, the results will contain a URL at
       `commands.run.href`.  POST to that to run the macro - no body required.

- name: "Outputs"
  description: |-
    These methods give you read access to Outputs in the Command Centre
    database, and let you override them.

    The first use case below introduces the main entry point.  It is a paginated search
    interface that gives you very basic data for any number of outputs.  The href field for
    each output gives the location of another page which gives more details, including the
    URL you need to switch the output.

    ### Override times

    1. End-times on overrides are not accurate to the second.  Internally, Command Centre
       converts the end time to a duration, so you may find that submitting end times in
       the very near future does not have the exact effect you expect.
    2. The end time you set for an override cannot be in the past or more than 24 hours
       into the future.

    ### Overrides always use 'on' and 'off'

    The Configuration client allows you to assign different display strings to the two normal output
    states, on and off.  On could be 'green', for example, and off could be 'red'.  Regardless, the
    overrides you apply to an output are called 'on' and 'off'.

    ### Status flags

    Status flags, on the other hand, use the language of the relays on the hardware modules.  They
    will report 'closed' for an output that is on, and 'open' for one that is off.

    If the output is online, its `statusFlags` field may contain one or more of these flags:

    - `relayStateUnknown` means the controller does not know what the output should be doing.
    - `closed` means the output relay is closed.
    - `open` means the output relay is open.
    - `pulsed` means the relay's change in state is momentary.
    - `switchingDisabled` means switching this output is disabled.

    - `overridden` can appear whether the output is online or offline.  It means the output has an
      override in effect.

    #### Output flag rules

    - If and only if the output is online, one of 'relayStateUnknown', 'closed', or 'open' will
      appear.  That is your test for whether an output is in error.
    - Of the above, only 'overridden' can appear when the output is offline.

    ### Use cases

    #### Listing Outputs
    1. `GET /api`.
    2. Follow the link at `features.outputs.outputs.href`, appending a search term such as
       `name=substring` to select the outputs, and `fields` to tell the server what to return about
       each.  The next section covers those query parameters.
    3. Process the results, following the `next` link until there isn't one.

    #### Switching an Output
    1. Find the href for the output using the process above.
    2. GET it.
    3. Find the API URL to turn the output on, off, or cancel a previous override in the
       `commands` structure of the [results](#definition-Output-detail).  Use the
       `until` variants if you are specifying an end time.
    4. POST to that URL.  Those with `until` in their command block keys require a JSON
       object in the body; the others expect it empty.

    #### Finding an output's status
    1. Find the href for the output using the process above, and GET it.
    3. Take the `updates` href from that page.  Append '?' or '&' (whichever is appropriate) then
       `fields=defaults,voltage` if you are after the fence's voltage.
    4. GET it.
    4. Use the flag rules above to interpret the status flags you receive.
    5. Follow the `next` link to stay up to date.

        Sends an override to an access zone to change its mode to 'secure - no PIN', meaning you
        will need a card, but not a PIN, to open its doors or perform overrides on terminals.

        The same URL with `_pin` on the end will send an override to the access zone to change its
        mode to 'secure - PIN', meaning you _will_ need a PIN on the door and on a terminal.

        If you do not give it an end time in the body, the override will remain in place until the

        depending on the reader's configuration.  You will not need a PIN on a terminal.

        The same URL with `_pin` on the end will override the access zone into 'code or card - PIN',

        If you do not give it an end time in the body, the override will remain in place until the

        'normal' state.

        It will not cancel a lockdown.  For that you need `cancel_lock_down`.

        This returns a summary of the doors matching your search criteria.

        The result will contain no more than 100 doors, or as many as you asked for more in
        your request; you should follow the `next` link, if it is present, to collect the next
        batch.

        If your result set is empty it means your operator does not have the privilege to view any
        doors, such as 'View Site', 'Edit Site', or 'Override - Open Door'.  Perhaps there are no
        doors in the divisions in which your operator has privileges, or your operator has no
        privileges at all.

        When you have loaded them all there will be no `next` link.

      summary: Search outputs
      description: |
        This returns a summary of the outputs matching your search criteria.

        The result will contain no more than 100 outputs, or as many as you asked for more in
        your request; you should follow the `next` link, if it is present, to collect the next
        batch.

        If your result set is empty it means your operator does not have the privilege to view any
        outputs, such as 'View Site', 'Edit Site', or 'Override'.  Perhaps there are no outputs in
        the divisions in which your operator has privileges, or your operator has no privileges at
        all.

        When you have loaded them all there will be no `next` link.

        Take this URL from the 'href' field in the `features.outputs.outputs` section of
        `/api`.
