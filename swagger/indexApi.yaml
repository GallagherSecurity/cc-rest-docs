  title: "Command Centre REST API"
  description: |
    Welcome to the developer documentation for the Command Centre REST interface.

    The files linked from here show you how you can manage Command Centre using HTTP requests.  Each
    file contains an introduction to its particular area of the API, instructions on authenticating
    to the server, and tips on how to accomplish common tasks, as well as the usual reference
    information for paths and data.

    They do not show how to set up the Command Centre server to answer your REST calls.  To do that,
    search the Configuration Client's online help for 'REST'.

    You could also look at the sample code shipped with Command Centre, on the install media
    alongside this documentation in the 'Utilities/REST API' folder.  There are several Visual
    Studio projects that compile into .NET applications you could observe making HTTP requests against
    your own server (in a development environment, of course).

    The documentation divides into:

    <table>
    <tr><td valign=top><a href=events.html>Alarms and Events</a></td><td>

      The alarms and events APIs date back to v7.80.  They let you download, monitor, and create
      events, and download, monitor, and manage alarms.

      The alarms and events events documentation also covers the parts of the API that exposes items
      and divisions.

      </td></tr>

    <tr><td valign=top><a href=cardholders.html>Cardholders</a></td>
      <td>
        The cardholder parts of the API appeared in v7.90.  They let you manage your users, their
        PDFs and credentials (cards), and their links to associated items such as access groups,
        roles, competencies, and lockers.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td valign=top><a href=rest.html>Status and Overrides</a></td>
      <td>
        These functions let you monitor and override several more Command Centre item types.  You
        can use them to watch the status of inputs, open doors, and run macros, for example.

      Access zones, alarm zones, fence zones, doors, macros, and outputs arrived in v8.00.  Inputs
      came with v8.10.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td valign=top><a href=piv.html>PIV cards</a></td>
      <td>
        This is a supplement that describes how to work with PIV and PIV-I cards, separated
        from the main cardholder documentation in the interest of brevity.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
