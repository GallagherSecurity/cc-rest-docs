  title: "Command Centre REST API"
  description: |
    Welcome to the developer documentation for the Command Centre REST interface.

    The files linked from here show you how you can manage Command Centre using HTTP requests.  Each
    file contains an introduction to its particular area of the API, instructions on authenticating
    to the server, and tips on how to accomplish common tasks, as well as the usual reference
    information for paths and data.

    They do not show how to set up the Command Centre server to answer your REST calls.  To do that,
    search the Configuration Client's online help for 'REST'.

    You could also look at the sample code shipped with Command Centre, on the install media
    alongside this documentation in the 'Utilities/REST API' folder.  There are several Visual
    Studio projects that compile into .NET applications you could observe making HTTP requests against
    your own server (in a development environment, of course).

      The API's reference documentation divides into:

      <table>
      <tr><td valign=top><a href=events.html>Alarms, events, and non-cardholder items</a></td><td>

        The alarms and events APIs date back to v7.80.  They let you download, monitor, and create
        events, and download, monitor, and manage alarms.

        The alarms and events documentation also covers API calls that support divisions and items
        as they relate to events, as well as bulk status monitoring.

        </td></tr>

      <tr><td valign=top><a href=cardholders.html>Cardholders and related items</a></td>
        <td>
          The cardholder parts of the API let you manage your users, their personal data and
          credentials (cards), and their links to associated items such as access groups, roles,
          competencies, and lockers.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td valign=top><a href=rest.html>Status and overrides</a></td>
        <td>
          These functions let you monitor and override several more Command Centre item types.  For
          example you can use them to watch the status of inputs, open doors, run macros, and
          modify schedules.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td valign=top><a href=piv.html>PIV cards</a></td>
        <td>
          This supplement describes how to work with PIV and PIV-I cards.  It is separate from the
          main cardholder documentation in the interest of brevity.
        </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
