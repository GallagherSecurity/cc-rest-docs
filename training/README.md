# REST training document

This directory contains an [Asciidoc (.adoc) document](rest_training.adoc) intended to accompany
online training.  It contains some useful reference material, and general good advice, so it remains
online for use by Gallagher staff and development partners.  It is not official Gallagher
documentation:  no claims are made about its suitability or veracity, or even sobriety.

Like the rest of the cc-rest-docs repository, the canonical source is
