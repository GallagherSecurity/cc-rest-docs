# Work in progress:  Command Centre REST API training material

This document will be a markdown port of a document used internally at Gallagher Group to train
developers in the use of Command Centre's REST API.  This version is not yet suitable for
publication, but if you are using the REST API and like the sound of 60-odd more pages of reading
material, please contact Gallagher through your channel partner and talk to our Technical Support
Engineers about your project.
